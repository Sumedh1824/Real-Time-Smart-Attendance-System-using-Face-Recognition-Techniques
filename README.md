# Real-Time-Smart-Attendance-System-using-Face-Recognition-Techniques
Our Institute has an ID card scanning system for attendance in dining halls and tracking student movement at the main gate. Forgetting ID cards hinders attendance and causes difficulties in entering/exiting the institute. Converting to a Smart System would make it easier for students, staff, and save time.
